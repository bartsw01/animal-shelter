      <h2>Rover - Dog</h2>
      <p>Rover is sweet little puppy who loves to play catch in the park.  He eats and sleeps because life is easy for him.  Sadly, he is blind from old age.  He is 15 years old.  He is close to death but we love his energy and incessant barking.</p>

      <h2>Iago - Bird</h2>
      <p>Iago is a chirpy, cheepy bird who we cannot at any time let out of his cage. He viciously pecks anyone who tries to pet him.  He has somehow torn off much of his beautiful feathers on his right.  We consider him as good as bald. </p>
